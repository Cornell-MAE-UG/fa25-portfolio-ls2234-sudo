<p>Introduction:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This portfolio examines a water-to-water heat exchanger operating in parallel-flow and counter-flow configurations. The device consists of two internal channels that allow hot and cold water streams to exchange energy through a conductive metal wall without mixing. This report will examine the thermodynamic behavior of this system and how changing the flow configurations affects its heat transfer performance by measuring the inlet and outlet temperatures of the hot and cold streams. Ultimately, understanding these thermodynamic differences provides direct insight into the design strategies used in real-world engineering applications.</p>

Qualitative Description of the Device

    The device used in this lab was a metal water-to-water heat exchanger with four plastic tubes creating two isolated internal channels, one of which is for hot water, and the other which is for cold water. There are four separate containers set up that act as tanks, one of which has ice and is insulated with styrofoam, and another of which contains an immersion heater. One pump circulates hot (orange) water from the tank heated with an immersion heater through tubes 3 and 4, going through the heat exchanger into an empty tank, while a second pump circulates cold (blue) water from the tank in styrofoam through tubes 1 and 2 into another empty tank. In this system, the heat exchanger allows the heat to pass from one water stream to the other through conduction across the metal and convection within each water stream without actually mixing the streams. 

    By changing which tubes are connected to which ends of the device, there is either parallel-flow, where hot and cold water flow in the same direction, or counter-flow, where the streams entered from opposite ends and flowed in opposite directions. This allows for a comparison of the heat-transfer performance based on the temperature distribution between the two configurations.
