For HW 5, we were asked to design a 2D lifting mechanism to maximize height and load, usiung an accuator of our choice from a catalog to hold a rod of our length, and solve for the height and length. 

My design used the IMA accuator to hold a rod of length of 50 cm and exert a max force of 36 kN on the rod. There is a pin attached one side of the accuator to the ground, one pin attaching the rod to the ground, and one pin connecting the rod and the accuator. To solve for the length and weight of the rod, I first established that I would encorporate the IMA accuator, as it was one of two accuators from the catalog that fit within the 150cmX50cm space the system occupied. Then, to make the computations easier and to assume for maximum height and force on the rod, I set the 50cm accuator to be at an angle where it was 40 inches in the horizontal and 30 inches in the vertical, so I can make the assumptions as I would for a 3-4-5 right triangle. I assumed that the max force exerted on the rod would be when the accuator was perpendicular to the rod and located at the end of the rod farthest from the ground. Because the accuator was 30inches off the ground in the vertical direction (+y), because the end of the rod was in contact with the top end of the accuator, I determined that the max height would be 30inches of the group. 

I then calculated the length of the rod based on these measurements. If the rod was perpendicular to the accuator and 30 inches of the ground, The length of the rod can be calculated through a calculation of angles, and the known length of the acculator in the x and y direction. 

First, I calculated the angle from the horizontal of the accuator, by taking the inverse tangent of the height of the accuator in the vertical direction (30 cm) over the length of the accuator in the horizontal direction (40 cm). This determined that the angle of the accuator from the x axis was approximately 36.87 degrees. 

Then, I used the right triangle created by the accuator, the rod, and the x axis to calculate the length of the rod. I first determined that the angle of the rod from the vertical was equal to the angle of the accuator from the horizontal. This was determined because the angle of the accuator from the horizontal and the rod from the horizontal are complementary within the same right triangle. Since the actuator and rod meet at a right angle through the connecting geometry, when you break the right triangle into two specific right triangles with the vertical, horizontal, and accuator length as one and the vertical, horizontal, and total rod length as the other, the triangles' respective angles with the horizontal and vertical must be equal. By knowing the height the rod is located at (30cm) and the vertical angle from which the rod is from the vertical (36.87 degrees), I can calculate the total length of the rod dividing the vertical length by the cosine of the angle from the vertical. This can be done because  Ly=Lcos(a), where Ly is the vertical component of L and a is the angle adjacent to Ly. 

Then, to calculate the maximum weight of the rod, we must first determine the forces acting at the top of the rod. I am assuming the weight of the rod is not uniform and is acting at the top of the rod. So, at the top end of the rod that is in contact with the accuator, there is weight of the rod which is pointing in the -y direction, the force of the pin on the rod parallel to the rod, as well as the force of the pin on the rod perpendicular to the rod. These forces are perpendicular and parallel to the rod because they are coming from the accuator that is on the other side of the pin that is perpendicular to the rod. On the bottom end of the rod where the pin is connected to the ground, there are two forces of the pin on the rod in the x and y direction. 

Next, we must take the moment of the rod from about the bottom of the rod that is attached to the x axis. This allows us to eliminate the forces of the pin at the bottom of the rod and the forces of the pin in the parallel direction to the rod from the top. We assume the force of the pin at the top of the rod perpendicular to the rod is the maximum force exerted bty accuator. We also assume the moment is zero because there is no rotation about the bottom pin as the system is stationary. The only of frce acting on the rod is also at the top of the rod, directing in the vertical direction, is the weight of the rod. To calculate the force of the weight perpendicular to the rod, we must use the angle we defined earlier of the rod from the vertical (36.87 degrees). To calculate the force of the weight acting perpendicular to rod, we can assuming Wperpendicular=Wsina, where a is the angle from vertical and W is the weight of the rod. 

Now, we can write out the moment equation by writing M=Wsina(L)-36(L)=0. We the can set Wsina=36 as the length at which the forces are acting from the bottom of the rod are the same. Then, by plugging in the angle a and diving 36kN by the sine of a, we determine that the maximum weight of the bar is 60kN. 

## Step 1 — Rigid Bar Design

### a) Problem Definition, Constraints/Objectives, and Degrees of Freedom

The goal is to design a planar lifting mechanism that fits within a **150 cm × 50 cm** design window and uses one actuator, one bar, and three pin supports (two grounded) to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. For Step 1, the bar is modeled as **rigid**, and all supports and the actuator are assumed rigid and frictionless.

**Constraints**
- Mechanism must remain within the 150 cm × 50 cm boundary.
- Exactly **three pin joints**, with two attached to the ground.
- Actuator must come from the provided catalog.
- Bar is treated as a rigid link.

**Objectives**
- Maximize **lifting height**.
- Maximize **supported load**.
- Maintain simple and manufacturable geometry.

**Design Degrees of Freedom**
- Bar length (determined by geometric constraints).
- Ground pin locations for the actuator and bar.
- Orientation of the actuator in the final lifted configuration.
- Location of the actuator–bar pin connection.
- **Beam cross-section and material** (documented now, applied later in Step 2):
  - Cross-section: **5 cm × 5 cm** square  
  - Area:  
    \[
    A = 25 \text{ cm}^2
    \]
  - Material: **steel**  
  - The bar is rigid in Step 1, but defining this geometry prepares for Step 2 bending analysis.

### b) Static Analysis (Rigid Bar)

To simplify geometry and maximize height, I positioned the actuator so its horizontal and vertical projections were **40 cm** and **30 cm**, forming a **3–4–5 right triangle**. This corresponds to an actuator angle:

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{30}{40}\right) \approx 36.87^\circ
\]

The actuator’s top pin sits at **30 cm height**, which becomes the mechanism’s maximum lift height.

Since the actuator is perpendicular to the bar at maximum load, the bar angle from vertical equals the actuator angle from horizontal:

\[
\phi = 36.87^\circ
\]

The bar length \(L\) must satisfy:

\[
L \cos \phi = 30 \text{ cm}
\]

\[
L = \frac{30}{\cos 36.87^\circ} \approx 37.5 \text{ cm}
\]

Thus the rigid bar length is **37.5 cm**.

### c) Load Capacity and Final Mechanism Design

At the lifted configuration:

- Weight \(W\) acts vertically downward at the top of the bar.
- The actuator applies its full **36 kN** force perpendicular to the bar.
- Taking moments about the lower pin removes reaction forces from the equations.

The perpendicular component of the weight is:

\[
W_\perp = W \sin \phi
\]

Moment balance:

\[
W_\perp L - 36\text{ kN} \cdot L = 0
\]

\[
W \sin 36.87^\circ = 36\text{ kN}
\]

\[
W = \frac{36}{\sin 36.87^\circ} \approx 60\text{ kN}
\]

**Final Step 1 Result:**  
The rigid-bar mechanism can theoretically lift **~60 kN** to a maximum height of **30 cm**.
